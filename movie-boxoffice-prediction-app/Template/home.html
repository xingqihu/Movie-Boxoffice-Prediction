                    <h3>Explanation of the dataset</h3>
                    <p>The data is pulled from IMDb's open database, which they update daily. The dataset is narrowed down to only movies released in the US between 1980-2020, then merged it with another dataset from TMDB, which contained details regarding budget and box office that IMDb's dataset didn't have</p>

                    <p>First, I removed all non-US movies, Then I changed the type of the release date column to datetime with pandas and some help from regex. Then I created a column for "profit" (gross revenue-budget)</p>
                    <p>The interesting part about the Total_Gross_Bankability is that your movie is more likely to make more money if you have star power, a qualitative measure of the popularity of your top actors. This can also apply, to some extent, to the popularity of the director (Martin Scorsese, Jon Watts and etc.) 
                        In order to quantify this bankability, I created a new dataframe with just actors and directos and mapped their top 4 movies they were known for, along with each movies'gross revenue and profit. Then I took the average of the gross and profit for each actor and director.
                        For each movie, I added the Average Gross the top billed actor for with the Average Gross of the director to get "Total Gross Bankability"
                    </p>
                    <h3>Statistical Methods Used</h3>
                    <p>First, I thought it necessary to remove outliers, as there are a handful of movies with box offices of over $1 Billion, that already affect out model.
                        A few James Cameron movies (Titanic, Avatar) and Marvel "Tentpole Movies" (The Avengers, Avengers:Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame) would be considered outliers.
                    </p>
                    <p>I classified outliers as movies with box offices more than 3 standard deviation away from the mean</p>
                    <p>Now, Let's calculate the new mean and standard deviation</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gross Mean: 63,085,873</li>
                        <li>Gross Standard Deviation: 98,445,947.42</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>budget?</p>
                    <p>runtime?</p>
                    <p>Total_Gross_Bankability?</p>
                    <p>We can use linear regression to measure the correlation to boxoffice</p>
                    <p>We can see that profit has the highest correlation to gross with a coefficient of 0.96</p>
                    <p>The next highest is budget with a correlation coefficient of 0.68</p>
                    <p>The third highest is Total_Gross_Bankability, our engineered feature to represent the "Total Start Power" of the actor and director, with a coefficient of 0.45
                    </p>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Budget and "Total Gross Bankability" (a quantification of a movie's start power) were statistically significantly associated with a movie's box office. 
                        Budget has a realatively strong correlation (0.68), and "Total Gross Bankability" had a moderate correlation (0.45).
                    </p>
                    <p>The year, runtime, and score had relatively weak correlation with box office
                    </p>
                    <p>Limitation of the analysis include missing data in all rows, which either had to be dropped or ignored. I also did not measure the correlation of categorical variables, only quantitative.
                        The dataset also only included movies released in the USA between 1980-2020, and excluded any movies released by streaming companies (like Netflix-Originals, since their business moel is not built around
                        "box office")
